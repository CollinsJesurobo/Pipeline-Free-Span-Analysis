METHODOLOGY:

A free span calculation has been carried out to determine the maximum allowable free span length  for a subsea gas export pipeline.
The assessment takes into account the functional and environmental conditions of the flowline to determine the limiting span lengths considering:

- Ultimate Limit State
- In-line VIV onset & screening
- Cross-flow VIV onset& screening
- Global buckling (Euler bar buckling)

The following load cases were assessed:
1. As-Laid – Ambient temperature, Flowlines empty (zero internal pressure)
2. Flooded – Ambient Temperature and Pressure. Flowlines flooded with seawater
3. Hydrotest – Ambient Temperature, Hydrotest Pressure. Flowline flooded with seawater
4. Operating – Operating Temperature and Pressure. Flowline filled with operating effluent

ASSUMPTIONS:

The following main assumptions apply to the Free Span Assessment: 

1. Constant thermal and pressure profiles along the flowline routes (design conditions)

2. Maximum water depth assumed for internal flowline pressure

3. Minimum ambient temperature assumed for each flowline

4. 150 mm field joint cut-back length

5. Zero residual lay tension

6. Thin wall approximation used for effective axial force calculation

7. Storm duration of 3 hours 

8. 5% Turbulence Intensity over 30 minutes (See Section 3.2.12 of DNV-RP-F105 [13])

9. Poisson’s ratio of Soil = 0.5

10. Structural Damping = 0.005 

11. Zero Hydrodynamic Damping 

12. Current and Wave particle velocity assumed to be perpendicular to the Flowlines

13. Fully locked in end conditions (i.e. constant effective axial force throughout length)

14. Seabed assumed horizontal.
