Methodology:
A free span calculation has been carried out to determine the maximum allowable free span length  for a subsea gas export pipeline.
The assessment takes into account the functional and environmental conditions of the flowline to determine the limiting span lengths considering:

- Ultimate Limit State
- In-line VIV onset & screening
- Cross-flow VIV onset& screening
- Global buckling

The following load cases were assessed:
- As-Laid – Ambient temperature, Flowlines empty (zero internal pressure). 
- Flooded – Ambient Temperature and Pressure. Flowlines flooded with seawater. 
- Leak Test – Ambient Temperature, Leak Test Pressure. Flowline flooded with seawater.
- Operating – Operating Temperature and Pressure. Flowline filled with operating effluent.

Assumptions:
The following main assumptions apply to the Free Span Assessment: 
 - Constant thermal and pressure profiles along the flowline routes (design conditions); 
-  Maximum water depth assumed for internal flowline pressure; 
-  Minimum ambient temperature assumed for each flowline; 
- 150 mm field joint cut-back length; 
-  Zero residual lay tension; 
- Thin wall approximation used for effective axial force calculation; 
- Storm duration of 3 hours 
-  5% Turbulence Intensity over 30 minutes (See Section 3.2.12 of DNV-RP-F105 [13]); 
-  Poisson’s ratio of Soil = 0.5
-  Structural Damping = 0.005 
- Zero Hydrodynamic Damping 
-  Current and Wave particle velocity assumed to be perpendicular to the Flowlines; 
-  Fully locked in end conditions (i.e. constant effective axial force throughout length); 
-  Seabed assumed horizontal.
